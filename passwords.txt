of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view
 and without hiding any thoughts in my mind and without lies to the actual
  truth with my clear open mind and clean heart, expressing what ever
   is embedded inside me for a long time which I didn't say because
    I was nervous. But today, by gathering all the courage and motivation,
	 I just want to say that I actually feel and think that I have absolutely 
	 nothing to say. Thank you.

Bachpan ke us ghareeb bachche se shart lagai hai..
Khwaab ke khatir nind ko aag lagai hai.. -Munawar Faroqui







I burned myself from inside it's just ash outside.

bruces satisfy me from not achiving what i've whished for.


maine aj apne bachpane ko uthane ki kosh ki 
buhut tota phota tha uthte uthe hi tot gathering

phir maine apni jawani se bat karni chahi 
to buhut door se awaz ai woh to anay se pehle hi chale gae

 to phir maine khud se pucha ab kia hai
 to kehna laga hasrat 

 maine pocha kis chiz ki  to 
 bola us tote phote ko samatne ki or os gae hue ko lotane ki 
 maine kahan janab ye to namumkin hai 

 to kehna lage main kia karon mar jaon 
 janab wahin chal basay 

  marne ki dua.

<!--People choose friends who aren’t good for them for other reasons, too. Sometimes it’s
because they want to rescue someone. This is more typical of young people, although the
impetus still exists among older folks who are too agreeable or have remained naive or
who are willfully blind. Someone might object, “It is only right to see the best in people.
The highest virtue is the desire to help.” But not everyone who is failing is a victim, and
not everyone at the bottom wishes to rise, although many do, and many manage it.

Business is not just about import and export your wealth, A business is also about selling your sentiments every day
every time every minute every second Because we are doing things that have nothing to do with us it's selling your
sentiments because you are not following your passion just because of so-called society and because now you're
responsible of your family so you have to do something for them otherwise this so-called society will blaim you because
you did nothing for them, it's ok to do something for them, but during your life, never stop dreaming. no one can take
away your dreams, so why do you stop dreaming if you don't think about something bigger in your life so how can you
achieve something bigger in your life now you are getting older if you don't start thinking about your not completed
dreams your life will over very soon.

When you are afraid to get exposed your life become prison

who you idiolize are not the real hero's they are playing the character of a hero some director producer made them hero for you
